          <p>Growing up I was always fascinated with graffiti and any form of art that orginated from street culture. I remember sitting in the backseat of the family van, quietly admiring tags, murals and pieces that I‚Äòd see while we drove around San Diego.</p>
          <p>I was one of those kids in high school who kept a notebook of pieces, and would spend more time practicing lettering, arrows, and characters, than I would studying algebra.</p>
          <p>More recently, I‚Äòve tried to reconnect with that passion of appreciating the same aesthetics within design. I‚Äòd argue that this love for art never escaped me. And this is why I keep designers, illustrators, and makers in the network.</p>
          <p>I know I have so much to learn when it comes to visuals and modern day tooling. Still, it‚Äòs something I love &mdash; and so the following pieces are just a few samples of some ideas I've used in blogs or what not.</p>
          <p>Nonetheless, I appreciate the the look. <span role="img" aria-label="prayer emoji">üôè</span></p>
