          <p>Growing up I was always fascinated with graffiti and any form of art that orginated from street culture. I remember sitting in the backseat of the family van, quietly admiring tags, murals and pieces that I‚Äòd see while we drove around San Diego.</p>
          <p>I was one of those kids in high school who kept a notebook of pieces, and would spend more time practicing lettering, arrows, and characters, than I would studying algebra.</p>
          <p>That passion of art and appreciating aesthetics within design never escaped me. To this day, I find myself trying to connect with the art-side of the brain.</p>
          <p>And while I have so much to learn when it comes the visuals, the following are just a few samples of some ideas I've used in blogs or what not.</p>
          <p>Appreciate the the look. <span role="img" aria-label="prayer emoji">üôè</span></p>
